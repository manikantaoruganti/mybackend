# Temporal Contract Engine (TCE)

## Deterministic Event-Sourced Contract Execution Platform

Temporal Contract Engine (TCE) is a production-oriented backend platform for managing delayed, rule-bound, replayable commitments in distributed systems.

The system demonstrates advanced backend engineering concepts frequently encountered in financial infrastructure, workflow orchestration systems, settlement platforms, payment processing pipelines, compliance engines, and high-reliability distributed services.

Unlike traditional CRUD applications that overwrite state and lose historical context, TCE adopts an event-driven architecture that preserves every significant business action as an immutable event, enabling replayability, auditability, deterministic recovery, and operational transparency.

# Executive Summary

Temporal Contract Engine is a distributed commitment execution platform.

The system manages business commitments that:

* must execute later
* depend on rules
* require auditability
* require replayability
* require deterministic recovery

Examples include:

* delayed payouts
* subscription renewals
* settlement workflows
* compliance verification
* scheduled approvals
* rule-driven transactions

---

# Problem Statement

Most CRUD systems suffer from:

* duplicate processing
* race conditions
* overwritten state
* lack of audit trails
* difficult debugging
* poor failure recovery

Example:

User submits a payment request.

Network timeout occurs.

Client retries.

System creates duplicate records.

Result:

Financial loss.

Operational incidents.

Customer complaints.

Temporal Contract Engine solves these issues through:

* Idempotent APIs
* Event Sourcing
* Replay Engine
* Distributed Scheduling
* Optimistic Locking
* Failure Recovery

# Core Features

### Contract Lifecycle Management

```text
PENDING
ELIGIBLE
EXECUTING
COMPLETED
FAILED
CANCELLED
```

### Event Sourcing

Every business action becomes an immutable event.

### Replay Engine

State can be reconstructed from event history.

### Rule DSL

Business rules are configurable.

### Kafka Event Streaming

Events are published for asynchronous processing.

### Redis Coordination

Used for idempotency and distributed coordination.

### Retry Mechanism

Automatic recovery from transient failures.

### Dead Letter Queue

Failed executions are isolated for investigation.

### Prometheus Metrics

Operational visibility.
